OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING SYSTEM (OOPS) – INTERVIEW NOTES

1. What is Object-Oriented Programming?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.
Objects contain both data (variables) and methods (functions). OOP helps in organizing complex
programs, improving code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.

2. What are the main principles of OOPS?
The four main principles of OOPS are:
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

3. What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and methods into a single unit called a class.
It helps in data hiding and protects the data from unauthorized access.

Example:
A class with private variables and public getter/setter methods.

4. What is Abstraction?
Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features of an object.
It is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

Example:
Using an interface to define methods without implementation.

5. What is Inheritance?
Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and methods of another class.
The class that inherits is called the child class, and the class being inherited is the parent class.

Example:
class Animal → class Dog

6. What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism means "many forms".
It allows methods to perform different tasks based on the object.

Types of Polymorphism:
1. Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading)
2. Run-time polymorphism (Method Overriding)

7. What is a Class?
A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.
It defines properties and behaviors that objects will have.

8. What is an Object?
An object is an instance of a class.
It represents a real-world entity.

Example:
Class: Car
Object: BMW, Audi

9. Difference between Abstract Class and Interface
Abstract Class:
- Can have abstract and non-abstract methods
- Supports constructors

Interface:
- Supports only abstract methods (before Java 8)
- No constructors

10. What is Method Overloading?
Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

11. What is Method Overriding?
Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method
already defined in the parent class.

12. What is Constructor?
A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects.
It has the same name as the class.

13. What is this keyword?
The 'this' keyword refers to the current object of the class.

14. What is super keyword?
The 'super' keyword refers to the parent class object.

15. Advantages of OOPS
- Code reusability
- Improved security
- Easy maintenance
- Better scalability
- Real-world modeling
